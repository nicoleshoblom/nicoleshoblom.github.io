    I am lucky that Pacifica is my home base whenever I travel back to the Bay Area in California. I recently stayed in Pacifica for a month for my kids' 2025 여름 방학 (Summer Vacation). It was our first time staying in the area during the July 4th holiday, which turned out be a big spectacle! Be ready for the best and loudest independent firework show of your life. If you want a really good seat, I recommend staying at this <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1219899249495627133?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=c7ae11d2-9356-43bf-8bb6-ec76756aeaa5">AirBnB</a>. There is also an annual July 4th festival hosted at Frontierland Park complete with rides, food, drinks, and live music!
    <span></span>
    Speaking of Frontierland Park, it's the only park in Pacifica with a big playground, an expansive well manicured field, picnic tables, and bbq's. There are a few other small playgrounds of note including the Pedro Point Community Playground, and one at the Pacifica Community Center right next to a sweet skate park. Kids will of course have a blast playing in the sand and water at Linda Mar Beach (aka Pacifica State Beach) and Rockaway Beach. Just be cautious during times of strong surf! 
    <span></span>
    The highlight of beaches in Pacifica during the Summer are the whales! Frequent sightings are possible at any of the beaches in Pacifica, like Mussel Rock, Pacifica Esplanade, and at the pier. A hot tip from yours truly: try to book some nights at this <a href="https://t.vrbo.io/DduCOUsp7Vb">short term rental gem</a>. It has a spectacular backyard view of Pedro Point where, with the help of binoculars, you can see whales at all the aforementioned places.
    <span></span>
    Pacifica is of course known for its beautiful trails. A few I have hiked are Pedro Point Headlands, Pacifica Rockaway Trail, Mori Point, Pacifica Quarry Trail, and trails at San Pedro Valley Park. I also highly recommend taking a short drive South to Moss Beach to explore JV Fitzgerald Marine Reserve.
    <span></span>
    After all the outdoor activity, explore the food and bar scene in Pacifica. Some of my faves are 
    Dinosaurs, 
    Top Pot, 
    Breakers, 
    Nick’s, and you have to visit the beachfront 
    Taco Bell Cantina at Linda Mar Beach! Since it’s a Cantina they serve alcohol! Also check out 
    Winter’s Tavern and 
    Long Boards if you’re wanting a dive bar scene. Craving something sweet? The señorita bread at 
    Starbread is a must-try, or visit the iconic 
    Mazetti Bakery for a wide selection of sweet treats. A bit further South are 
    Sam’s Chowder House, 
    La Costanera, and the 
    Fish Market in Half Moon Bay. You can also drive north to Daly City for Korean cuisine at 자갈치 (Jagalchi) at the Serramonte Mall. I also love 
    Cafe Colma inside of Lucky Chances Casino that serves top notch Filipino food 24 hours a day!
    <span></span>
    To my readers - staying in Pacifica will give you the quintessential oceanside California experience. It’s also very easy to reach both San Francisco and the SF international airport from Pacifica. I can’t wait to visit this small, hippy, beach town again! Thanks for reading my post, and happy travels! 잘 여행예요!
