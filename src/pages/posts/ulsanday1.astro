    It’s on my to-do-list to watch Train to Busan, and take the train there for real! But recently, I did take a Korail speed KTX train from Seoul to Ulsan for a 2박 3일 (2 night, 3 day) weekend getaway with the family. We booked the train tickets only a week in advance, and we were lucky to find enough seats. However, we were all placed in non-adjacent seats and in different cars! I could not figure out seat selection on the Korail site with economy tickets. But when there is enough seats, Korail will automatically seat your party together. Lesson learned - book Korail speed train tickets one month in advance! We did try to change our seats at the Seoul Station ticket counter about an hour before our departure, but all seats were sold out and only standing room was available. Another lesson I learned as a first time KTX ticket buyer - don’t buy your tickets on railmonsters.com (AI might recommend this). Just buy them directly from <a href="https://www.korail.com/global/eng/main">Korail</a>.

    Ulsan is in the South East of South Korea just North of Busan. We stayed right on the ocean in 강동 in 북구 (Gang neighborhood in Buk district), which was a quiet, small town, but lightly peppered with high rise apartments and hotels, including ours. 
    <span></span>
    Shortly after checking in, we took a stroll along Gangdong Beach on our way to dinner. The beach was of course stunning, and we discovered that you can camp, have fires, and shoot off fireworks on the beach.  However, the real highlight of our walk was 강동중앙공원 (Gangdong Jungang Park). This park was a set of 3 playgrounds going up a hill. The second highest playground had a 3 story climbing structure that my boys climbed like pros. Their motivation was of course the long slide they could ride from the very top.
    <span></span>
    To my readers - If I visit Gangdong again, it will be to camp on the beach. If you check it out, be ready for the desire to explore outside of the town. This will of course require some traveling by bus, car, or taxi. In fact, we also visited <a href="https://www.nicoleshoblom.com/posts/ulsanday2/">Gampo</a> and Daewangam on this trip. and And if all else fails, you can always have fun at a Noraebang (노래방) aka Karaoke room! Thanks for reading and 오세요 (come) again!.
